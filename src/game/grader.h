// Human-style solver used to grade puzzle difficulty.
//
// It solves the way a person does: always apply the easiest technique that
// makes progress, and note the hardest one ever needed. That hardest
// technique is the puzzle's level. Plain C++ (tested on the PC).
//
//   Level 1  Singles         naked single, hidden single
//   Level 2  Locked cand.    pointing, claiming
//   Level 3  Subsets / fish  naked + hidden pairs and triples, X-Wing
//   Level 4  Advanced        Swordfish, XY-Wing, XYZ-Wing
//
// A puzzle that needs something beyond level 4 (chains, guessing) can't be
// finished by this solver.
